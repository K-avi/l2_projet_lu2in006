This is the repo for a college project where I had to create 
a git-like command line app. 
The source files of the project are in the src/ directory. 
The comments are written in french and the source files are structured 
by exercise number. 
The project was guided and I didn't choose the implementation 
of it's different parts. 
Similarly the questions helped to understand what you needed to do. 

With all of that being said I still feel like it's relevant to showcase
the result on a repo and make it public. 

The project is published under the Unlicense so feel free to do whatever
you want with it.

PS: please note that the commits of the project as well as the comments / function documentation are all written in french due to it being a college project
